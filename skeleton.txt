Skeleton version B, released 8-19-1998.
---------------------------------------
This skeleton D-Mod is being offered in the spirit of fair exchange of
ideas! It should allow you to begin writing a new D-Mod simply by unzipping
it (maintain folders if in WinZip, or -DO if Pkunzip for DOS).

  >> Edit the title-01.bmp in the GRAPHICS sub-directory to customize
     your own title screen.

  >> Edit the button bmp's to customize your own buttons.

  >> Edit the START files to customize things like the button
     positions, Dink's starting room #, and the intro music.

  >> Edit the DMOD.DIZ file and create your own info for front ends.

  >> My "custom" tile set is in tiles/ts39.bmp (ALT-9 in editor). You can
     delete this file for the original ts39 tile page to be used.

  >> Dink starts in Room #400 (which has been set up on the map). Change
     this room to whatever you like -- even start him out in a different
     room by changing &player_map in START.C.

If you need more hints, be sure to check out my web site! I've got a FAQ,
a developer's forum, and lots more to help ya get started.

Why am I don't this? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE WRITING TONS
OF D-MODS!!! <Hehhehhe>

Good luck!
