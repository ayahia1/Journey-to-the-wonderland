# Journey-to-the-wonderland (A new version of Dink Smallwood game)
**Journey-to-the-wonderland** is a video game created as a group project conducted through a competition that took part at the "Fundamentals of Computer Science" course hosted and organized by the American University in Cairo, under the supervision of Professor Nawal El Boghdady.

## The Game Story
This game follows a young man named Dink, whose lust for adventure is stopped by his motherâ€™s orders. One day, when a raider attacks his pig farm,
Dink shows great independence and strength in fighting off the raider. After

pastures.

## Notes
* The game's final score (~103) exceeded the maximum possible score (100).
* The main challenge encountered while building the game was self-learning the game scripting language and various game editor tools in less than 3 weeks.
* Building the entire game took around 2 months.
* The team has not found any bug in the game yet; however, this does not mean that there are no bugs. Feel free to reach out if you find any.

## Final words
* I want to extend my gratitude to Professor Nawal El Boghdady for her guidance and help throughout building the game. I also give special thanks to Adam Salem and Adham Khalid, **my teammates**, for their co-operation and help through the whole competition process.
